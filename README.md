# Frankfurt Theater House

Theater Website for a mock-up theater in Frankfurt am Main. 
The website shows whats on using images and short descriptions including the time date and cost of admission for the performance.
Additional info provided via Googlemaps show the location of a (random theater) here in Frankfurt am Main.

A Youtube video of an up and coming band (friends of mine) is listed as an upcoming performance.

Course: Full Stack Web Developer - Code Institute Dublin Ireland.
First front-end milestone project.

## UX
Users should be able to see whats on when how much it costs and book a ticket for an event at the theater.

## Features

### Existing Features
- Simple general layout and typography.
- Colours, in particular the green, look nice.
- Navbar collapses for smaller width screens.
- Links to Booking page all work well.
- Social media icons and links working well.
- Payment buttons for PayPal and Stripe work well.
- Form on booking page is easy on the eye.

### Features Left to Implement

1. Proper responsiveness e.g. 
- the navbar collapses to a hamburger when scaling the webpage down however when the hamburger is clicked the list items don't open.
- the active selector on the nav items is not currently working - the idea is to mark the page the user is on.
- images are not scaling down with the pages correctly.
- the logo vanishes when scaling down.

2. Logo transition on hover as on: https://www.victorianopera.com.au/ to be added. 

3. Dropdown Menu of events on hover over navbar to be added.

## Technologies Used

1. HTML to create a webpage
2. CSS  to style the webpage
3. Bootstrap to aid responsiveness with mobile first applications in mind.
